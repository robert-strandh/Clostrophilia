;;;; Whenever a generic function is initialized or reinitialized,
;;;; whenever a method is added or removed from a generic function, we
;;;; invalidate the discriminating function by setting it to a
;;;; function that, when called, recomputes a valid discriminating
;;;; function from the call history and then attempts to call the
;;;; generic function again with the same arguments.
