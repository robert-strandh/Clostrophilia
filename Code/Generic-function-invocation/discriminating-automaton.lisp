;;; Discriminating automaton.
;;;
;;; The discriminating automaton is used to construct a discriminating
;;; function.  As such, it is not used during normal execution of
;;; application code, but only when the discriminating function of
;;; some generic function needs to be recomputed.
;;;
;;; The structure of the discriminating automaton encodes a series of
;;; tests to determine an effective method, given the unique class
;;; numbers of the specialized required parameters of the generic
;;; function.  At the moment, the automaton always encodes tests from
;;; left to right.  In other words, the unique class number of the
;;; leftmost specialized parameter is tested first.  It might be
;;; advantageous for some configuration of method specializers to test
;;; in a different order, but we do not consider that possibility at
;;; the moment.
;;;
;;; Each state of the automaton can be considered to belong to a
;;; particular LAYER.  For a generic function with N specialized
;;; required parameters, the corresponding automaton has N+1 layers,
;;; numbered from 0 to N.  Layer 0 consists of a single state, namely
;;; the initial state.  Layer N consists of final states, each
;;; corresponding to a particular effective method.
;;;
;;; For any particular sequence of N unique class numbers, the
;;; automaton will make exactly N transitions.  It might be possible
;;; in some cases for an automaton to make fewer transitions.  As an
;;; example, consider a generic function with the following method
;;; specializers (all classes): (A T B) (A T C) (D E F).  If the first
;;; test determines that the class of the first required argument is
;;; A, then only the first two methods are potentially applicable.
;;; Neither of the first two methods specialize on the second required
;;; parameter, so in this case, the class of the second required
;;; argument does not need to be consulted in order to determine which
;;; of the first two methods is applicable.  As a consequence, if the
;;; class of the first required argument is A in this case, then it
;;; would be possible for the automaton to make only 2 transitions.
;;; However, this kind of optimization would require detailed
;;; knowledge about the particular subclasses of generic functions and
;;; methods in question, as well as of the way the methods on
;;; COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS-USING-CLASSES work for those
;;; subclasses.  For now, then, we require no such detailed knowledge.
;;; The only information we use is that a particular sequence of
;;; unique numbers of classes should trigger the execution of a
;;; particular effective method.
;;;
;;; The discriminating automaton is computed from the call history of
;;; the generic function.  Recall that the call history of the generic
;;; function consists of a set (represented as a list) of call caches.
;;; For the purpose of building the discriminating automaton, each
;;; call cache contains a class number cache and an effective method
;;; cache.  Several different call caches may share the same (EQ)
;;; effective method cache.
;;;
;;; We represent the automaton as nested lists.  We deliberately avoid
;;; using classes so as to avoid circular dependencies.

;;; A STATE of the automaton is either a FINAL state or an INTERNAL
;;; state.  A final state has no transitions associated with it, and
;;; instead it has an ACTION.  Final states with identical (EQ)
;;; actions are considered equivalent.  An internal state has a list
;;; of transitions associated with it.  During construction of the
;;; automaton, some internal states may have an empty list of
;;; transitions, but in the final automaton, every internal state has
;;; a non-empty list of transitions associated with it.  There can
;;; never be two transitions in a state with the same label (see
;;; below).  Two internal states with the same set of transitions
;;; (same number of transitions, same labels, leading to equivalent
;;; states) are considered equivalent.  A state is represented as two
;;; CONS cells.  The CAR of the first cell contains either :INTERNAL
;;; or :FINAL according to whether the state is an internal or a final
;;; state.  The CAR of the second cell is initially NIL and will later
;;; be used to hold a GENSYMed NAME of the state.  If the state is a
;;; final state, then the CDR of the second CONS cell contains the
;;; action.  If the state is an internal state, the CDR of the second
;;; CONS cell contains the list of transitions.
