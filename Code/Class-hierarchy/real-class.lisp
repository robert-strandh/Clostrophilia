(defgeneric class-precedence-list (class))

;;; This function is similar to CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST, except that
;;; CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST is specified to signal an error when the
;;; class is not finalized, which we accomplish by using a :BEFORE
;;; method.  However, during class finalization, we need to access the
;;; class precedence list in the two steps following its computation.
;;; Since at that point the class is not yet finalized, those two
;;; steps can not call CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST.  Our solution is to
;;; define an alternative reader for the same slot, named
;;; PRECEDENCE-LIST, and which does not signal an error if the class
;;; is not finalized.
(defgeneric precedence-list (class))

;;; This function is used by the class finalization protocol to set
;;; the precedence list of the class.

;;; This function is used by ALLOCATE-INSTANCE and
;;; ALLOCATE-BUILT-IN-INSTANCE to determine the size of the instance
;;; to allocate.
(defgeneric instance-size (class))

;;; This function is used during class finalization, when the
;;; effective slots are known, and it is therefore also known what
;;; size the instances of this class should have.
